# Shopicruit Task
* This is part of my application (task one) to the Shopify summer 2016 internship
* I decided to write task one in two languages namely Perl and Javascript

###[Task](https://www.shopify.com/careers/developer-intern-summer-2016-ea3921)
"Complete this 'Shopicruit' task we created just for you: You've discovered the Shopify Store 'Shopicruit'. Since you're obsessed with computers, you want to buy every single computer and keyboard variant they have to offer. Unfortunately you can only carry up to 100kg and may not be able to buy all of them. By inspecting the JavaScript calls on the store you discovered that the shop lists products at http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json. Write a program that calculates what the maximum amount of computers and keyboards that you could carry would cost you. Attach your answer (in dollars) and your program (any language) and answer in your reply."

###My interpretation of the task
* I'm assuming that different colours of the same type of computer as variations of computers. Eg. A blue and a red "Awesome Cotton Computer" is counted as two computer variants.
